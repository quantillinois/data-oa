\chapter{Current Project}

\section{Optimizing the ML Model}
A Logistic Regression model and Decision Tree was used, with both identifying true positives(actual disputes) with low accuracy.
\subsection{If a package such as XGBoost is optimized for the data set, then the model bias will be less than the Logistic Regression model.}
\subsection{With deeper analysis on the data set, then the ML model will have greater accuracy with respect to consumer disputes.}

\section{Data Insights}
For the following featuresâ€“product, state, submission method, and issue:
\subsection{The more commonly used the financial product is within the company, the more likely it is to be disputed}
\subsection{If a consumer is located on the West Coast of the United States, then they are more likely to dispute.}
\subsection{If a consumer uses an digital form of communication, then they are more likely to dispute their resolution.}


\chapter{Additional Hypotheses}

\section{Data Exploration}
\subsection{Interactive map with highlights of different zip codes.}
\subsection{Robust, accurate sentiment analysis on product, sub-product, issue, and sub-issue and even narratives.}
