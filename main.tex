\section{Machine Learning Applications}
\subsection{A basic NLP model can be implemented to track the sentiment of both the consumer and the bank in their statements.}
\subsection{This model can be combined with the other columns in the dataset to predict whether the consumer will dispute.}
\subsection{By changing the wording of its statements as well as how it markets itself, the company can reduce costly disputes.}
\section{Other Applications}
\subsection{The company can work to see if location and product are actually correlated with the amount of disputes.}
\subsection{If so, the company may want to focus in a single region in the beginning that does not have a high percentage of disputes.}
\subsection{It is also worth investigating how interactions between consumers and customer service representatives affect disputes.}
\subsection{The company can also try to figure out whether certain types of customers are prone to sending in disputes while others do not care at all about the outcome.}
